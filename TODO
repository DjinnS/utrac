Utrac 0.1
=========

Soon:
- Remove first half of each charset in charset.dat file (ascii!) and add
correspondant code.
- Add an option to print a list of each extended character in each charset
that is used in the file
- port utrac to windows and mac
- Improve installation


Later:
- charsets.dat file should be in source code and not loaded
- The charmaps should even be extracted from the system (with iconv for example)
- Add real conversion to ASCII (é->e, æ->ae, etc...)
- Manage other charsets : UTF-16, 32 and 7, html entites (&#), quoted printable...
- Improve detection algorithm (manage vowels/consonant: for instance 3 vowels
are unlikely)
- Accept a directory as input file, and recognize/convert the name of its files.
- Add a language recognition based on letter frequency to do a second selection.


- Lot of other things to do!
