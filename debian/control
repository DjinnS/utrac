Description: command line tool that recognize the encoding of an input file
 UTRAC stands for Universal Text Recognizer and Converter.  It is a command line tool and a library that recognize the encoding of an input file (ex: UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, CP437...) and its end-of-line type (CR, LF, CRLF).
 .
 It has three main features:
 .
    * Automatic recognition (depending on the file and on the system's locale), reliable in most cases;
    * Assistance for verification or manual recognition;
    * Conversion to an other charset and/or end-of-line type.
